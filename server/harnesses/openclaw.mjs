/**
 * Harness adapter: OpenClaw — the agent gateway this machine itself runs on.
 *
 * Everything that knows the shape of OpenClaw's own files lives in this one module, per the
 * contract in `server/harnesses/README.md`. Sessions are JSONL transcripts under
 * `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/`, one file per conversation, each opening with a
 * `{"type":"session", …}` header line carrying the id, the start time and the cwd.
 *
 * Beside the plain `<uuid>.jsonl` transcripts the directory holds per-topic continuations
 * (`<uuid>-topic-<ts>.jsonl` — a Slack thread spun out of a session, with the parent's id in
 * its header), trajectory mirrors (`.trajectory.jsonl`), checkpoint snapshots
 * (`.checkpoint.<uuid>.jsonl`), path sidecars, and deleted-file tombstones (`.deleted.<ts>`).
 * Only the conversation transcripts are read here; the topic files are included because they
 * are real conversations, and each carries the session id in its header, so they key cleanly.
 *
 * The head also names the *repo* a session actually worked on. Almost every session starts in
 * the shared workspace, so `cwd` alone would pile every project onto one plot; the repo is
 * voted out of the paths, GitHub refs and command lines the transcript mentions — see
 * `detectProject`.
 *
 * The transcript head is also where the *kind* of a session shows. OpenClaw writes no
 * parent-child metadata, but the openings are distinctive: a webhook arrives as
 * `Task: <source> | Job ID: …` wrapped around an untrusted-content fence, a cron fire as
 * `[cron:<id> <label>]`, a heartbeat poll as its own fixed line, and a spawned sub-agent as a
 * `[Subagent Context]` opener under an agent other than `main`. Cost arrives the same way —
 * `usage.cost.total` on every assistant message — so a session's spend is summed out of the
 * head plus the tail without reading a long transcript whole. All of it is cached against
 * mtime and size, exactly like the rest of the metadata.
 *
 * Read-only, without exception. OpenClaw writes these files while it works; this adapter only
 * ever opens them for reading and never writes one byte back.

 * A file that is *not* growing but was touched moments ago can still be live: the model is
 * thinking — the user's message, a tool result, or a tool call is the last thing on disk and

 * flight means the session is running for all the colony cares; an assistant reply that said

 *
 * "Unread" is deliberately not answered here. File mtimes cannot say whether a person has
 * looked at a conversation, and guessing — anything that stopped growing moments ago must be
 * awaiting a reply — flipped between polls, which showed as ghost "need you" counts that
 * vanished between one click and the next. The thread is either running or it is not; whether
 * you have read it is the colony's own bookkeeping (`viewedAt`), not the file's.
 *
 * "Thinking" is answered here, though, and it is the one thing the fresh-but-not-growing
 * case can say for sure: a user record as the last thing on disk means input landed moments
 * ago and the model has not written anything back yet — it is processing. The colony draws
 * that as its own status (purple trim, thought bubbles) rather than folding it into
